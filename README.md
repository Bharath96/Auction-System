Web-based Auction systems are a major component of electronic marketplace that
allow users at any site to sell and buy products. The sellers set up auctions for their
products while the purchaser who bids the highest amount wins the right to purchase
the product in an auction. Only registered users are allowed to use the system. In
order to build the above system, we used an agent based approach for our
implementation. There are three kinds of agents – PurchaserAgent, SellerAgent and
FacilitatorAgent. The SellerAgent provides the function of registering goods for an
auction to the sellers. The second agent is the PurchaserAgent that requires bidding
to buy and it suggests a proper bidding price by analyzing the bidding history of the
bidding competitor. The third agent is the FacilitatorAgent that plays the role of an
auctioneer and enables a bidder to look at the other person’s auction history while
bidding for and buying a product.

Now this is 2nd version.
